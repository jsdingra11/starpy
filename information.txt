This repository provide the python code which utilizes the basic photometic paramenter to get the SFH parameter - tau and tage, which is used to study the variation fo SFR over time for the galaxies in study.
The code implies Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to get the values of tau and tage. 
Futhermore, this help to check the age of the galaxies, if we have few more parameter like metallicity and redshift of the galaxy
